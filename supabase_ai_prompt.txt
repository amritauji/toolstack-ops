Show me the current structure and data for my profiles table including all columns, data types, and sample data. Also show me all RLS policies currently applied to the profiles table and whether RLS is enabled. Additionally, show me my storage buckets configuration especially the 'avatars' bucket and its policies. Finally, check if there are any triggers or functions set up to automatically create profiles when users sign up through auth.users table. I'm having issues where user profiles (names and avatars) are not displaying in my Next.js app and getting 406 errors when fetching profile data.
